# cifar-10-in-keras
-> CIFAR-10 object recognition dataset.

-> Create a simple Convolutional Neural Network for object recognition.
# Dataset description
-> The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 photos divided into 10 classes (hence the name CIFAR-10). Classes include common objects such as airplanes, automobiles, birds, cats and so on. The dataset is split in a standard way, where 50,000 images are used for training a model and the remaining 10,000 for evaluating its performance.

-> The photos are in color with red, green and blue components, but are small measuring 32 by 32 pixel squares.
